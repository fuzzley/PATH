Prototype website of a mobile app for a project in Human Computer Interaction class.

The website can be seen at http://fuzzley.info/path.

Since the website is a prototype of a mobile app, it is best viewed on a mobile or tablet device.

The website is designed as a "Single Page App", utilizing [hasher](https://github.com/millermedeiros/hasher/) and [crossroads](https://millermedeiros.github.io/crossroads.js/).

The [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) library is used for most of the styling.

[Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) is used for some of the functionality (like paging through the "Simple Manual" steps).
